# Godot Grappling Hook System
A swinging grappling hook mechanic made in godot for platformer games. It is for my [godot grappling hook tutorial](https://gameidea.org/2024/08/24/make-grappling-hook-in-godot/).

In this tutorial, I made a pendulum in godot & then converted it into grappling hook system by adding player attachment and detechment logic.

Overall, it is useful if you want to make a pendulum in godot, grappling hook, swinging rope or chain, or anything similar.

The system is modular adn designed to be integrate-able in any game, though it might need some tweaks for specific games.
