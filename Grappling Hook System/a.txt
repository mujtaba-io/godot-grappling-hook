Hardcoding different capabilities in the player is not a good idea;
for example, our player can have grappling skill (to swing/climb on rope achhored to some point).

In RTS games like commanods 2, we have different characters with different capabilities, and we should not hardcode
any capability in them, for it will render inefficient in future and hard to modify.

Instead, we should have a list of Skills[] for each character & all the skills shouldf be added in an "additive" fashion, that is,
in a way that the skill mechanic handles itself and player himself is not aware of the skill. Thus whatever the player chacrter will be,
if it has skill in his skills[], the skill will render itself.

The skill should listen to inputs, user actions and everything in environment and perform the work without the parent player
knowing anything.

In Grappling Hook Mechanics, we will create a scene with a rope, an anchor joint, and a rigid body. When it is the time for
grappling hook to trigger (that is user ahs pressed the action button), the skill will automatically adds the player character body as child of the
grappling hook rigid body, and uses the raycast to detect the achor point nearby, and expands the line2D to visualize the rope.

And when its time to stop the animation of grapling mechanics, the skill itself resets it and sets the player to its orignal form.
